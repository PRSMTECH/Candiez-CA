## NEXT STEPS FOR CODING AGENT

The next agent should:

1. Run `npm install` in both client/ and server/ directories
2. Get the first feature with `feature_get_next` MCP tool
3. Start implementing features in priority order:
   - Priority 1-20: Authentication & Security
   - Priority 21-40: Navigation & Core UI
   - Priority 41-60: Customer Management
   - Priority 61-80: Product & Inventory
   - Priority 81-100: POS & Transactions
   - Priority 101-120: Loyalty Program
   - Priority 121-140: Reports & Settings
   - Priority 141-155: Polish & Edge Cases

4. For each feature:
   - Mark as in_progress using `feature_mark_in_progress`
   - Implement the functionality
   - Test using Playwright MCP (unless YOLO mode)
   - Mark as passing using `feature_mark_passing`
   - Commit progress regularly

5. Key implementation priorities:
   - Database schema and models first
   - Authentication system (JWT)
   - Base UI components (Button, Card, Input, Modal)
   - Sidebar navigation and layout
   - Customer CRUD operations
   - Product catalog and inventory
   - Point of Sale interface
   - Loyalty program logic
   - Reports and dashboard
